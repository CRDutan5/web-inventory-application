### Create a Cellphone
When creating a cellphone to add to the inventory you will have to enter certain characterstics regarding the cellphone. For example, we'll be using the:

"Motorola Moto G Power 2023 Mineral Black 256GB"

As seen below just enter the information for the respective field.

Note: Make sure to fill all information because some may be required to fill out. In addition, some inputs may give you advice on how to fill them!

As you can see, the "Motorola Moto G Power 2023 Mineral Black 256GB" has been successfully added to the inventory of the Pursuit Mobile Store.

Also, a reset button was added for the users convenience. In case the user was inputting information that was incorrect the reset button allows them to completely clear out all the input fields and start fresh again.


### View and Update the Inventory

The way this website was designed was to split it into two main columns. One side for the current inventory and the other side is the create a cellphone to add to the inventory.

A feature that was added to update the inventory was the use of a stock toggle button. Whenever the user would need to update the inventory status of a cellphone. By a click of a button the "In Stock" button toggles to "Out of Stock" and vice versa. That way the user is always in control of the inventory status.

Not only this but a remove button feature was also implemented along with each cellphone just like the stock button. The remove button allows the user to completely remove that specific cellphone from the inventory simply by the click of a button.
